# VSCode CodeMath Extension

The VSCode CodeMath Extension is a powerful tool that enables mathematical calculations and evaluations directly within Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

To use the CodeMath Extension, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Extension**: Open the Extensions view in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac). Search for the extension by name, "CodeMath", and click on "Install" to install it.

2. **Open a file or create a new one in Visual Studio Code**.

3. **Type a mathematical expression**: In the editor, type the mathematical expression you want to evaluate. End the expression with the `=` symbol. For example, `2 + 2 =`.

4. **View the calculation**: After typing the `=` symbol, the CodeMath Extension will calculate the result and display it in the editor immediately after the `=` symbol. For example, `2 + 2 = 4`.

5. **Evaluate and write the result**: To accept and write the calculated result, press the Enter key. The result will be written to the right of the `=` symbol. For example, `2 + 2 = 4`.

**Note**: CodeMath supports various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and advanced functions (sin, cos, tan, log, %, sqrt, ^, max, min, pi, etc.).
